// One special thing about a tournament is that, other than the champion, other participants will not get the exact rank. 
// Instead, they will only be viewed as "top k", for k = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... 

// Assume there are 洧녵 participants in total, where 洧녵 is a power of 2. The strength of each participant, the 洧녰-th robot, is noted as 洧논洧녰, which is an integer in range [1,10^9]. 
// Assume your own robot is always shown up in this list as the first one (i.e., 洧논1 is the strength of your robot ). 
// All 洧논洧녰 values are distinct so there wouldn't be a tie.

// You decide to hack the system before the competition, so that you could rearrange the schedule, and decide opponents for all competitions. 
// What the best rank your robot can achieve, i.e., find the smallest value of 洧녲, such that your robot could rank top 洧녲
//  in the tournament, where 洧녲 is also a power of 2.

// Input
// The first line of the input is an integer 洧녵
// , which is the number of robots in the competition. 洧녵
//  is guaranteed to be a power of 2.

// The second line of the input contains 洧녵
//  integers. The 洧녰-th integer 洧논洧녰 is the strength of the 洧녰-th robot in the competition. Your robot is always the first one in the list, so its strength is 洧논1.

// Output
// The output contains a single integer, 洧녲, which means "top 洧녲" is the best rank that Monte can achieve, if they carefully rearrange the tournament schedule. 
// 洧녲 must be a power of 2.
